    "copy1": "Green Rooms is the UK’s first arts hotel, a social enterprise that offers affordable accommodation aimed at people working in the arts.",
    "copy2" : "We are excellently located opposite Wood Green tube station, just 12 minutes from King’s Cross and 20 minutes into Central London direct by tube. <br><br> We focus on what you really do need: great beds, decent showers, and friendly and knowledgeable creative staff (who all live locally and can tell you exactly where’s good to go). We have easy access to wi-fi and we serve proper coffee and fresh pastries to get you going in the morning.<br><br>There’s nothing too fancy, and no TV sets in the rooms. We’re ideal for people who want to make the most of London, and just want a simple and chic place to rest during their stay. Why pay for things you don’t need? Save your pocket money for those irresistible gallery gift shops. We’re more special than a hostel, and more hearty than a chain hotel.",
    "copy3" : "Green Rooms has a lobby bar with local beers, homemade cakes and cocktails. The interior was designed by our co-founder Kurt Bredenbeck and theatre producer Mandeep Tutt. Architects Soda created the interior (we're located in a re-purposed art deco office block) and fashion label Folk designed some of the furniture in the rooms.",
    "copy4" : "We’re home to Colombian Street Kitchen on the ground floor. Visitors can host their London friends here and chat over a tasty plate of empanadas. We hope our guests will interact and engage with one another, have conversations and maybe even collaborate.",
    "copy5" : "We also have a gallery and a bustling diary of arts events. Join our newsletter and be the first to hear about what’s going on here. We hope to meet you soon!"
