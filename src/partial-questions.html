Everyone is welcome at Green Rooms, we are a hotel for Haringey, and for London. However Green Rooms does offer preferential rates for practising artists and people coming to London working in the creative industries. This does not just entail fine artists (e.g. painters and sculptors), but thespians, musicians, writers, designers and all manner of creative individuals!
