We have easy access to wi-fi and we serve proper coffee and fresh pastries to get you going in the morning.<br><br>There’s nothing too fancy, and no TV sets in the rooms. We’re ideal for people who want to make the most of London, and just want a simple and chic place to rest during their stay. Why pay for things you don’t need? Save your pocket money for those irresistible gallery gift shops. We’re more special than a hostel, and more hearty than a chain hotel."
