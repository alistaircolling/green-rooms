                                    further liability to you arising out of such cancellation.  We will,

                                    however, use reasonable endeavours to try and re-locate any confirmed

                                    Booking cancelled by us to an alternative location similar in

                                    standard to the Hotel.

                                    Your booking is for a class of room in the Hotel and does not

                                    guarantee that you will be able to stay in a specific room or in the

                                    same room for the duration of your stay. If you have indicated a

                                    preference for a particular room we will use our reasonable efforts

                                    to honour this preference. However, we may need to allocate an

                                    alternative room to you for operational or safety reasons. If we need

                                    to move you to a different room during your booking for which a lower

                                    rate is available than the rate you booked at, we will refund you the

                                    difference in the rates.</div>
