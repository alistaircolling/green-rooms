                                <br>
                                WE FOCUS ON WHAT YOU REALLY DO NEED. GREAT BEDS, DECENT SHOWERS, AND FRIENDLY AND KNOWLEDGEABLE CREATIVE STAFF (WHO ALL LIVE LOCALLY AND CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHERE’S GOOD TO GO). WE HAVE EASY ACCESS TO WI-FI AND WE SERVE PROPER COFFEE AND FRESH PASTRIES TO GET YOU GOING IN THE MORNING.
THERE’S NOTHING TOO FANCY, AND NO TV SETS IN THE ROOMS. WE’RE IDEAL FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE MOST OF LONDON, AND JUST WANT A SIMPLE AND CHIC PLACE TO REST DURING THEIR STAY. WHY PAY FOR THINGS YOU DON’T NEED? SAVE YOUR POCKET MONEY FOR THOSE IRRESISTIBLE GALLERY GIFT SHOPS. WE’RE MORE SPECIAL THAN A HOSTEL, AND MORE HEARTY THAN A CHAIN HOTEL.
